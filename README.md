# 🌍📍 Locate Me Backend

Welcome to the **Locate Me** backend! This project is designed to empower people with disabilities by helping them share their **location** and **needs** with trusted contacts such as volunteers, NGOs, family members, and good Samaritans. ❤️ 

### 🎯 **Project Aim**
The goal of the **Locate Me** project is to create a **React Native** app with voice control and a **minimal UI** to ensure it is accessible and easy to use for individuals with disabilities. The app will be a vital tool for communities to assist those in need, offering a way to connect with help quickly and efficiently. 

By enabling users to share their exact location and the assistance they require, this platform helps connect those who need aid with people who can offer it. We aim to create a **safe**, **supportive**, and **connected** environment. 🌱
